ML is meant to be practical, so we will also go one step further and play with some practical applications that arise from the underlying math. The point, then, is not only to intuitively understand ML algorithms, but also see where and how they can be purposed. Therefore, each part will consist of **math** and some **easy-to-follow Python code** which practically applies the math.\n"
